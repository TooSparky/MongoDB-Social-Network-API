# MongoDB-Social-Network-API

## Description

This project is only back-end, so that I can work on handling MongoDB and Mongoose data. The application went smoothly, and I learned about virtuals. The project takes in a user and thought, while adding functionality for a friends counter and reactions.

## Installation

To install, simply clone this repository, and install the required npm packages in the package.json. After that you will need some sort of way to look at the back-end data. I used Insomnia in this case.

## Usage

There is no pre-seeded data, so you have the freedom to choose exactly what you want to enter into the application.
